My 1st repository to hold tips, tricks, resources, links, and conversations about coding in Python

### About me
- Started as a business undergrad
- worked in the financial industry utilizing my natural people skills
- always leaned into the data oriented roles, but just focused on solving hard problems
- Realized after watching Moneyball that everything about data and math to drive decisions makes me excited
- decided to go to grad school for Data Analytics
- Went to MIT to study Data Science courses
- Now I do automation as my main thing, but my heart will always be in analytics/data science
- This is why I'm here!
